        <h3>Drafting and Design</h3>
        <p>
         While attending Lakewood Ranch High School, I fell in love with Architecture, especially the drafting and design portion of it. After my Sophmore year of high school, I landed an internship with a local architect in Sarasota. The company was named Wenzel Grove and I spent the next two summers, leading up to college, working for this company. Some of the assignments I was given were: property-line plans, inner floor plans, electrical plans, foundation plans, roof plans, and cross-sections to name the majority.

          I began my career at Florida Atlantic University in the fall of 2005 as an Architecture major. The first couple of semesters were exhausting to say the least. I mostly worked on CADD or manual presentations through high school, but the college curriculum was taking me in a completely different direction. Florida Atlantic's courses were based mostly on model building, perspective sketches, and some manual drafting. I resided in the dorms my freshman year, which you can imagine was not the best scenario for keeping projects and models in one piece. This is when I slowly transitioned to a degree in Ocean Engineering.

        <h4>Ocean Engineering</h4>
        <p>
          Following my third year studying Ocean Engineering, I took some time off from school and landed a job with Sea Diversified. My brother currently worked for the company out of Delray Beach. He gave me the reference I needed to schedule an interview. I started working for the company just before the summer of 2014 as a rodman. My main duties at the time were: setting up the tide staffs, reading tides, and beach swims. The beach swims consisted of standing a 25 foot rod vertical every 20 feet from the shoreline out to about 350 feet offshore. I had to do this 10-15 times a day, 5 days a week. By the end of summer, I was in the best shape of my life. Most days were calm and the water clear, but there were also those days where the conditions were sketchy to say the least.

          I slowly transitioned to boat work from there. My duties included: driving and trailering the 28 foot boat, making sure we were clear of swimmers as we approached the shoreline, and making sure we were on the correct track as we drove the 3500 foot lines from offshore to the shoreline. Another job that I was involved in was a side scan sonar of the channel inside the intracoastal waterway from New Smyrna through the Florida-Georgia line, looking for shallow spots. I decided to leave the company in the beginning of 2015 due to the stress of "living out of a suitcase" every week. I am thankful for this experience because it allowed me to see all of Florida and I even got a chance to visit the Bahamas, working at the Disney island.
