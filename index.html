        <h3>Background</h3>
        <p>
          I grew up on the west coast of Florida in a city named Bradenton. After high school I attended Florida Atlantic University where i studied Psychology, Architecture, Drafting and Design, and Ocean Engineering to name a few. I took a mental break from the college life to work for an Ocean Engineering and Surveying company. After a year in the field, constant travel, and little to no life outside of the company, I decided I needed a career change.

        <p>
          I have worked in the restaurant industry for as long as I can remember, especially while I was attending college. I have done the nine to five job as well. I have even enjoyed a very profitable, yet stressful at times, career as a professional poker player. I know it is hard to believe, but I do have hobbies as well! I enjoy surfing, fishing, swimming, and basically anything I can get my hands on in the great outdoors.
